Overview
The challenge

Users should be able to:

    View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
    See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked

Screenshot

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like FireShot to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it.

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.

What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>

.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}

const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out The Markdown Guide to learn more.



Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.



    Example resource 1 - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
    Example resource 2 - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
